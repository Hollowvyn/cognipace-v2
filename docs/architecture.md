# Architecture

## System Shape

CogniPace v2 is a local-first WXT Chrome MV3 extension. It has four runtime
surfaces:

- Popup: compact command surface for review-now and study-next guidance.
- Dashboard: larger inspection and management surface for Library, Tracks,
  Settings, Overview, and Analytics routes.
- LeetCode content-script overlay: in-page practice session UI and LeetCode page
  capture bridge.
- Background service worker: trusted runtime boundary for database access,
  sender authorization, service calls, snapshot persistence, and cache
  invalidation.

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
entrypoints -> app -> features -> platform/lib/components
```

Entrypoints boot surfaces. The app layer composes screens, routing, providers,
and surface shells. Features own product behavior. Platform and lib modules own
shared infrastructure and product integrations. Shared UI components stay
generic.

## Source Layout

- `src/entrypoints`: WXT boot files for `background.ts`,
  `leetcode.content.tsx`, `popup`, and `dashboard`.
- `src/app`: surface composition, dashboard routing, popup shell, overlay app,
  providers, and app-level styles.
- `src/components`: shared UI primitives only, currently under
  `src/components/ui`.
- `src/extension`: extension runtime messaging plus background service-worker
  policy and handler registration.
- `src/features`: product-owned feature modules.
- `src/hooks`: shared React hooks that are not owned by one feature.
- `src/lib`: product integrations such as FSRS, GitHub, and LeetCode readers.
- `src/platform`: browser, database, HTTP, query, secrets, and time
  infrastructure.
- `src/styles`: shared styling support.
- `src/testing`: shared fixtures, setup, helpers, and boundary tests.
- `src/types`: shared TypeScript types.
- `src/utils`: small generic utilities.

Keep new code inside the owning feature or infrastructure folder. Avoid adding a
new cross-cutting layer unless it removes proven duplication.

## Runtime Surfaces

### Entrypoints

Entrypoints in `src/entrypoints` are thin boot files:

- `src/entrypoints/background.ts` registers background handlers.
- `src/entrypoints/popup/main.tsx` mounts the popup React app.
- `src/entrypoints/dashboard/main.tsx` mounts the dashboard React app.
- `src/entrypoints/leetcode.content.tsx` mounts the LeetCode overlay content
  script.

Entrypoints should not own product logic. They connect WXT to the app layer.

### App Layer

The app layer owns surface composition:

- `src/app/providers`: Query Client, cache invalidation listener, and shared
  React providers.
- `src/app/popup`: popup app shell and popup-specific components.
- `src/app/dashboard`: TanStack Router routes, navigation, route modals, and
  dashboard pages.
- `src/app/overlay`: LeetCode overlay app composition.

App code may coordinate features, but domain rules and persistence belong in the
owning feature or platform module.

### Features

Features own product capabilities. A typical feature folder can contain:

- `api`: runtime contracts, serializers, and surface-facing API hooks.
- `components`: feature-owned React components.
- `data`: repositories and persistence adapters for that feature.
- `domain`: pure domain models, rules, reducers, and calculations.
- `hooks`: feature-owned React hooks.
- `server`: background-service-worker service functions.

Not every feature needs every folder. Add only the folder needed for the change.

## Feature Ownership

- `app-shell`: popup, dashboard, and overlay shell data composition.
- `analytics`: local dashboard analytics read models: evidence-gated
  historical charts, current retention health, fragile knowledge, future load,
  and explainable readiness. It owns chart presentation contracts but not
  practice persistence or FSRS scheduling.
- `overlay-session`: LeetCode overlay UI state, timer, draft fields, page sync,
  submission automation, and review action orchestration.
- `practice`: FSRS-backed practice state, review logs, scheduling details,
  suspension, resets, and current log updates.
- `problems`: problem identity, catalog rows, Library behavior, edit data,
  companies, standardized topics, topic alias resolution, topic parent rollups,
  difficulty, premium status, and page upserts.
- `queue`: review recommendation composition for today.
- `tracks`: curriculum tracks, groups, ordered memberships, active track and
  group state, progress, and dashboard track management.
- `settings`: persisted preferences, defaults, validation, and settings form
  behavior.
- `sync`: GitHub Gist configuration, sync metadata, directional pull/push
  rules, Settings/header sync UI, and background orchestration.
- `genai`: AI provider settings contracts, trusted provider key storage,
  provider network adapters, and background-owned BYOK provider calls.
- `dev-smoke`: hidden dashboard-only extension development smoke checks for
  background health, Analytics, queue, notifications, GenAI config, and opt-in
  live GenAI provider validation.
- `assessment`: assessment domain rules.
- `leetcode-capture`: LeetCode metadata, content, and submission result reads
  through the content-script/background bridge.

When behavior crosses features, keep writes behind the owning feature's server
service or repository and return serialized data through the runtime boundary.

## Runtime Messaging

Runtime messaging is the extension boundary between UI surfaces and trusted
background work.

- Feature API contracts live in `src/features/*/api/*-contracts.ts`.
- Shared protocol types and message helpers live in `src/extension/messaging.ts`.
- Sender and method authorization lives in
  `src/extension/background/runtime-policy.ts`.
- Background handler registration lives in
  `src/extension/background/register-handlers.ts`.
- Feature service functions live in `src/features/*/server`.
- Feature repositories and persistence adapters live in `src/features/*/data`.
- The hidden dashboard smoke route at `/dev/smoke` calls dashboard-only
  `devSmoke.run` for local extension development checks; it is not part of
  primary dashboard navigation.

The normal request path is:

```text
UI hook or surface action
-> feature API method / sendMessage
-> src/extension/messaging.ts protocol method
-> registerBackgroundHandlers()
-> Zod request parse
-> sender authorization in runtime-policy.ts
-> feature server service
-> feature data repository if persistence is needed
-> Zod response parse or serializer
-> UI cache update through TanStack Query
```

### Runtime Boundary Rules

- Validate every request and response that crosses the extension boundary with
  Zod schemas from feature API contracts or `src/extension/messaging.ts`.
- Add every callable method to `src/extension/messaging.ts` and authorize its
  allowed surfaces in `src/extension/background/runtime-policy.ts`.
- Do not trust claimed `surface` values until
  `assertCanSenderCallExtensionMethod` has compared the request to the actual
  Chrome sender.
- Serialize `Date` values as ISO strings in runtime contracts. Convert them back
  to `Date` objects inside background services or domain code.
- After database writes, flush the database snapshot before broadcasting cache
  invalidation.
- Broadcast invalidation tags for every query family affected by a write.

## State And Data Flow

SQLite is the source of truth. TanStack Query is the UI server-state cache.
Local component state is for draft fields, filters, open dialogs, and transient
surface state.

The mutation flow is:

```text
user action
-> runtime command
-> DB write
-> sync metadata dirty mark for local mutations
-> snapshot flush
-> invalidation broadcast
-> safe automatic push scheduling when Gist sync is configured
-> query refetch
-> render
```

Background mutations are serialized through the mutation queue in
`src/extension/background/register-handlers.ts`. The app DB comes from
`src/platform/db/instance.ts`, which restores a matching stored snapshot or
creates a fresh migrated and seeded database.

### Analytics Read Models And Chart Story

Analytics is a feature-owned, read-only calculation. The background Analytics
service reads the full review history once for a request, together with the
current FSRS cards and supporting local state; chart components do not make
per-chart database calls. Its data flow is:

```text
review and FSRS inputs
-> analytics range policy
-> effective evidence window and readiness
-> metric-specific presentation buckets
-> Zod runtime contract
-> explicit chart components
```

The owners in that flow are:

- `src/features/analytics/domain/analytics-range-policy.ts` selects and builds
  local-date bucket boundaries. The current contract supports 14-day daily,
  30-day three-day, and 90-day weekly presentation buckets.
- `src/features/analytics/domain/analytics-readiness.ts` derives the effective
  window and readiness gates. `S`, `A`, `G`, `K`, and `E` mean eligible
  assessments, active buckets, longest gap, gap runs, and effective buckets.
- `src/features/analytics/domain/chart-buckets.ts` and
  `src/features/analytics/domain/chart-data.ts` aggregate each metric only from
  eligible evidence, preserve unknown buckets as `null`, and classify solid or
  dashed next-valid-point line continuity. Practice Rhythm retains zero-volume
  buckets after its first supported bucket.
- `src/features/analytics/api/analytics-contracts.ts` validates the serialized
  read model with Zod before it crosses the extension runtime boundary.
- `src/features/analytics/components/charts/chart-definitions.ts` is the typed
  chart catalogue: title, question, data meaning, eligibility, aggregation,
  semantic series, and sparse-state copy. `LineSegments` in
  `src/features/analytics/components/charts/line-segments.tsx` renders measured
  runs and dashed next-valid-point bridges without interpolating data.
- `src/lib/leetcode/domain/problem-url.ts` owns canonical problem URLs; the
  retention details and fragile-knowledge rows use `createLeetCodeProblemUrl`
  rather than constructing links in chart components.

The Analytics service applies the range policy, calculates readiness separately
for each metric's eligibility rules, trims only unsupported leading history, and
then builds its Zod-validated summary. Historical readiness is exposed as
confidence context; it does not suppress available Recall Quality, Practice
Rhythm, Memory Strength, or Recent Overdue Backlog points. Current Retention
Health, Fragile Knowledge, and the fixed 14-day Upcoming Review Load do not
depend on the historical range being ready.

Readiness diagnostics are a read-only view of that same production
calculation—not a second implementation. They include `S/A/G/K/E`, selected
bucket boundaries, gate thresholds, and which evidence each metric accepted or
rejected. Treat the diagnostics as an explanation of the serialized chart data;
do not use them to recalculate a competing result in the UI. Queue summaries
expose `dueToday`, `newAvailable`, `queueLoad`, and `recommendationReason`
aliases while preserving legacy queue fields for existing consumers.

Due-review notifications are local background work. The extension declares the
Chrome `notifications` permission so `src/extension/background/due-notification.ts`
can create one due-review reminder per day when enabled. Notification scheduling
uses Chrome alarms, local dedup state, and the queue summary `dueToday`
semantics; React components must not call `chrome.notifications` directly.

Automatic Gist sync is orchestrated in the background layer. After a local
mutation commits, sync metadata is marked dirty, the database snapshot is
flushed, normal invalidation is broadcast, and an alarm-backed auto-push is
scheduled when Gist sync is configured. Alarm jobs run through the same mutation
queue as manual sync work, so remote restores and local writes stay serialized.

Opening popup, dashboard, or overlay surfaces calls the safe
`sync.checkRemoteOnOpen` runtime path. That path clean-pulls changed remote Gist
data only when local metadata is not dirty; dirty local data skips the remote
fetch. Manual `sync.pullLatest` and `sync.pushLocal` runtime methods remain
dashboard-only. Pull requests default `confirmLocalOverwrite` to `false` and
push requests default `confirmRemoteOverwrite` to `false`; the sync service
enforces both defaults so force pull and force push only happen after a UI
confirmation dialog. The `enabled` flag controls automatic sync only; manual
directional actions remain available whenever token and Gist configuration are
present.

## External APIs And Secrets

External network calls use request declarations over `src/platform/http`. REST
and GraphQL integrations should define typed request functions in the owning
`src/lib/<integration>/api` module and inject `fetch` in tests. Feature services
or readers call those declarations instead of constructing ad hoc `fetch` calls.

Current integrations:

- `src/lib/github/api`: GitHub Gist REST requests for sync.
- `src/lib/leetcode/api`: LeetCode GraphQL and submission REST requests used by
  LeetCode capture readers.
- `src/features/genai/server/providers`: approved BYOK GenAI provider calls from
  trusted background code.

BYOK secrets use `src/platform/secrets`, backed by `chrome.storage.local` with
trusted-context access. UI surfaces may save or delete secrets through runtime
messages, but secret reads stay in the background service worker. Secret values
must not be exported in backups, serialized in sync envelopes, logged, or stored
in TanStack Query cache payloads. Stored-token validation also runs through a
dashboard-authorized runtime method so the UI can test the saved token without
receiving or echoing the secret value.

GenAI provider keys use `src/platform/secrets` with provider ids
`genai:openai`, `genai:anthropic`, and `genai:google`. UI and runtime status
payloads may expose provider key presence only. Raw keys must not be written to
the app database, backup exports, sync envelopes, logs, or query cache. Approved
provider host permissions are exactly:

- `https://api.openai.com/*`
- `https://api.anthropic.com/*`
- `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*`

Provider calls run from trusted background code after settings and BYOK secret
presence checks. Development smoke may optionally call the configured provider,
and smoke output must redact any provider error details that could contain a
secret.

## Database And Persistence

Database files live under `src/platform/db`:

- `src/platform/db/schema`: Drizzle schema modules.
- `src/platform/db/migrations`: generated SQL migrations and metadata.
- `src/platform/db/migration-sql.ts`: bundled migration SQL used at runtime.
- `src/platform/db/seed.ts`: initial local catalog seed.
- `src/platform/db/instance.ts`: app DB opening, migration, snapshot restore,
  snapshot scheduling, and snapshot flushing.
- `src/platform/db/snapshot.ts`: Chrome storage snapshot serialization.

Schema change rules:

- Update the owning schema module in `src/platform/db/schema`.
- Generate a migration with `npm run db:generate`.
- Check migrations with `npm run db:check`.
- Update repositories, serializers, feature contracts, and tests that touch the
  changed shape.
- Keep database writes behind the owning feature repository or service.

Local-data reset caveat: changing migrations changes the migration fingerprint.
When a stored snapshot does not match the current migration SQL, the app clears
the old snapshot and creates a fresh migrated database seeded from
`src/platform/db/seed.ts`. Testers may lose local extension data after schema
changes.

### Problem Topic Graph

The problems feature owns topic writes and read models:

- `topics` is the durable topic registry. Rows include stable ids, display
  labels, and timestamps.
- `topic_aliases` resolves variant labels to topic rows by normalized alias key.
- `topic_relations` stores parent rollups, including multiple parents for a
  child topic.
- `problem_topics` stores direct problem-topic assignments only. Parent rollups
  are derived for read models instead of being written as assignments.

Manual Library create, edit, and bulk metadata writes use replace semantics for
direct problem topics: the saved topic list replaces the previous direct topic
assignments after alias resolution. LeetCode capture writes use merge semantics:
captured page topics are resolved and added to the existing direct topic set
without clearing local or manual topics.

Backup schema version 3 exports and restores `topics`, `topicAliases`, and
`topicRelations`. Older supported backups are normalized into the version 3
shape during parsing by adding topic timestamps and empty alias/relation arrays
before restore validation.

## Query Invalidation

Query keys live in `src/platform/query/query-keys.ts`. Invalidation tag mapping
lives in `src/platform/query/cache-invalidation.ts`.

Background writes broadcast events with tags such as `practice`, `problems`,
`queue`, `settings`, `sync`, `tracks`, and `app-shell`. The listener in
`src/app/providers/cache-invalidation-listener.tsx` parses the event and
invalidates the mapped query keys.

When adding or changing data dependencies:

- Add or reuse a query key in `src/platform/query/query-keys.ts`.
- Add or update tag mapping in `src/platform/query/cache-invalidation.ts`.
- Broadcast the smallest correct set of tags from the background write path.
- Include cross-feature query families when a write changes derived views. For
  example, problem catalog writes can affect Library, practice details, queue,
  track workspace, and shell data.

## UI Architecture Rules

- Keep UI surfaces compact and direct. Popup is not a mini dashboard.
- Dashboard pages own layout and route-level composition; feature components own
  feature-specific interaction and display.
- Route definitions and modal nesting live in
  `src/app/dashboard/navigation/routes.tsx`; route labels and path metadata live
  in `src/app/dashboard/navigation/route-manifest.ts`.
- Feature components should call feature API hooks or receive already-loaded
  data. They should not reach into repositories or database modules.
- Keep draft form state local to the surface or feature hook until the user
  saves.
- Put shared primitives in `src/components/ui` only when they are product-agnostic
  and reusable by multiple surfaces.
- Use the tokens and interaction direction in `design.md` for visible UI work.
- Validate empty, loading, error, and disabled states for popup, dashboard, and
  overlay changes.

## Common Change Recipes

### Add Runtime Method

1. Add request and response schemas in the owning feature's
   `src/features/<feature>/api/*-contracts.ts`.
2. Add serializers in `src/features/<feature>/api` if the response contains
   dates, domain objects, or database rows.
3. Add the method to `ProtocolMap` in `src/extension/messaging.ts`.
4. Add allowed surfaces to `methodSurfaceAccess` in
   `src/extension/background/runtime-policy.ts`.
5. Register the handler in `src/extension/background/register-handlers.ts`.
6. Parse the request with Zod, authorize the sender, call the owning feature
   service, and parse or serialize the response.
7. If the method writes data, run it through the DB mutation flow, flush the
   snapshot, and broadcast invalidation tags.
8. Directional sync methods such as `sync.pullLatest` and `sync.pushLocal` must
   follow the same Zod parsing, sender authorization, owning service,
   snapshot-flush, and invalidation rules. Destructive overwrite flags must
   default to `false` in the Zod request schema and be asserted in handler tests.
9. Add focused tests for contracts, authorization, handler behavior, and the
   calling API hook as appropriate.

### Add Database Table Or Column

1. Update the relevant Drizzle schema module in `src/platform/db/schema`.
2. Export it through `src/platform/db/schema/index.ts` if needed.
3. Run `npm run db:generate` and review the generated migration under
   `src/platform/db/migrations`.
4. Run `npm run db:check`.
5. Update feature repositories in `src/features/<feature>/data`.
6. Update feature domain models, API contracts, serializers, and services.
7. Update seed data in `src/platform/db/seed.ts` if fresh installs need default
   rows.
8. Add or update repository and integration tests.
9. Tell testers whether local extension data may reset because of the migration
   fingerprint change.

### Add Or Modify Dashboard Route

1. Add or update the page in `src/app/dashboard/screens`.
2. Update route metadata in `src/app/dashboard/navigation/route-manifest.ts`.
3. Update route definitions and modal nesting in
   `src/app/dashboard/navigation/routes.tsx`.
4. Put route-level layout in `src/app/dashboard/layout` when it is dashboard
   structure, not feature behavior.
5. Put reusable feature UI in `src/features/<feature>/components`.
6. Read and mutate data through feature API hooks.
7. Add route tests in `src/app/dashboard/routes.test.tsx` and feature component
   tests for meaningful behavior.

### Add Feature Mutation

1. Define the user-facing behavior in the owning feature.
2. Add or update the feature API contract and client API hook.
3. Implement domain validation or state transitions in
   `src/features/<feature>/domain`.
4. Implement persistence in `src/features/<feature>/data` if the mutation writes
   local data.
5. Implement the background service in `src/features/<feature>/server`.
6. Register the runtime method and allowed surfaces.
7. Serialize dates and response objects at the runtime boundary.
8. Broadcast invalidation tags for every affected query family.
9. Test the domain rule, repository or service write, runtime handler, and UI
   caller.

### Change Popup Behavior

1. Start in `src/app/popup/popup-app.tsx`,
   `src/app/popup/popup-shell.tsx`, and popup components under
   `src/app/popup/components`.
2. If the change alters shell data, update `src/features/app-shell`.
3. If the change alters queue recommendations, update `src/features/queue`.
4. If the change alters study-mode or track guidance, update
   `src/features/settings` or `src/features/tracks`.
5. Keep popup state compact and avoid moving dashboard workflows into popup.
6. Update popup tests and any affected feature tests.

### Change Overlay Behavior

1. Start in `src/app/overlay/overlay-app.tsx` for composition changes.
2. Use `src/features/overlay-session` for overlay UI state, timer, drafts, page
   sync, submission automation, and review actions.
3. Use `src/features/leetcode-capture` for page metadata, content, and
   submission result reads.
4. Use `src/features/practice` for saved review results and practice details.
5. Use `src/features/problems` for problem upserts from page data.
6. Preserve content-script-only access for LeetCode read methods in
   `runtime-policy.ts`.
7. Test collapsed, expanded, docked, timer, draft, save, and page-sync behavior
   when the change touches those flows.

### Add Or Change External API Calls

1. Add request declarations in the owning `src/lib/<integration>/api` folder.
2. Use `src/platform/http` REST or GraphQL helpers instead of direct `fetch`.
3. Keep product parsing and fallback behavior in the owning feature or reader.
4. Inject `fetch` or `HttpClient` in tests; do not hit real external services.
5. Redact credentials and sensitive values from thrown errors or debug payloads.
6. Add request-shape tests plus focused behavior tests at the reader/service
   boundary.

## Validation By Change Type

- Docs-only change: run `npx prettier --check <changed-docs>`.
