# Superpowers Planning Artifacts

This folder contains planning artifacts created through Superpowers workflows. These files are useful history, but they are not the first source of truth for current product behavior or architecture.

## Current Authority

- Current product behavior and scope: [`docs/product.md`](../product.md)
- Current architecture and change recipes: [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md)
- Manual testing and validation: [`docs/testing.md`](../testing.md)
- UI and interaction direction: [`design.md`](../../design.md)
- Agent operating rules: [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)

## Specs

- [`specs/2026-06-08-agent-governance-drift-audit-design.md`](./specs/2026-06-08-agent-governance-drift-audit-design.md): Phase F design for adding a lightweight file-path-based drift audit checklist to the canonical agent governance doc after the first hardened release cycle, without adding new scheduled automation yet.
- [`specs/2026-06-08-github-governance-templates-design.md`](./specs/2026-06-08-github-governance-templates-design.md): approved design for reinstating concise GitHub PR and issue templates, direct Bug/Task type labels, Project auto-add expectations, PR hygiene checks, stale PR handling, and workflow hardening before agent-specific enforcement.

## Reading Guidance

Use these files to understand why work was shaped a certain way. Before changing product behavior, architecture, or tests, check the current docs and source code first.
